* *How does Mart's Lists learn suggestions?*   
  Mart's Lists learns the intervals in which you use to add a particular item to your list when you remove it from the list. So to teach it an interval you have to add and remove an item at least twice. Once Mart's Lists has learned an interval it updates it every time you remove the corresponding item.
  Please note that if you remove an item within 10 minutes after you have added it to a list, Mart's Lists won't suggest that item anymore until you add and remove it once more from the list.

* *When does Mart's Lists suggest items automatically?*   
  An item can be suggested once Mart's Lists has learned an interval for it and if it is not ignored. An item will be ignored if you remove it within 10 minutes after adding it to the list. If you want to stop ignoring an item just leave it for more than 10 minutes on the list. 
  A new susggestion is added to a list if the interval for an item will be over in 36 hours or if 90% of the interval is already over.

* *Can Mart's Lists learn different suggestions for different lists?*   
  Yes. Suggestions and their intervals are always unique to each list.

* *How can I reorder lists and items?*   
	Tap on the action button in the upper left or right corner and select "Reorder Lines". You can also tap and hold on any list to enable the edit mode.
