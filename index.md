# Welcome

This website points to apps and open source projects I've written. The apps in question are available in the App Store and the open source projects are hosted on GitHub. So this website is primarily for support and additional information.

## Apps

{% assign pages_list = site.pages %}
{% assign appstore_links = "no" %}
{% include helpers/apps_list.html %}

Please find support and FAQs in the [support section](support/).

## Open Source Projects

* [NASfVI](http://github.com/spartusch/NASfVI)   
  A server to parse and answer questions in German using Prolog and Apache Lucene. Includes an AJAX front-end and goodies too. Please find [more information on NASfVI](legacy-website/html_de/nasfvi.html) in German.

You are *very* welcome to clone and contribute to these projects! :)

## The Other Website

Also there is my [other website](http://spartusch.github.com/legacy-website). Check it out to find more programs I've written like programs for Windows and a little compiler. This 'legacy' website is still maintained but updated infrequently.
